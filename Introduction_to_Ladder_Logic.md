## 1. Introduction to Ladder Logic

### What is Ladder Logic?

Ladder Logic is a graphical programming language used in industrial automation. It originated from relay-based control systems and continues to be relevant for programming PLCs across various industries.

### Basic Constructs and Operations

Ladder Logic is composed of several basic constructs that are essential for automation tasks:

1. **Inputs (Contacts) and Outputs (Coils):** Inputs receive signals from physical devices like sensors and buttons, while outputs control actuators such as motors and lights.  
2. **Timers and Counters:** Timers provide time delays or timed operations, while counters count occurrences of events.  
3. **Internal Relays:** Internal relays perform intermediate control functions without being connected to physical devices.
